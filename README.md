# Data_Driven_Design
Projects from the Data-Driven Design course at EPFL, led by Prof. Josie Hughes, focused on applying machine learning to engineering design problems. The main project involved simulation and modeling of a soft robotic tentacle, with design optimization performed using a genetic algorithm.
